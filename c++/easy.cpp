/*
INTRODUCTION TO C++

It is a general-purpose programming language
Designed and implemented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs
It will run on a variety of platforms such as Windows, MacOS, and the various versions of UNIX

FUN FACT: the inital verison of c++ was called "c with classes"
  Meaning that c++ is the extention of c 
    a major feature that is in c++ but not in c is the concept of classes


C++ is:
  * a better c
  * supports data abstraction
  * supports object-oritented programming
  * supports generic programming

Now let's compare 

An example from the c language: 
  let 'i' be an integer variable whose value = 6
  now, i++ will incremenet the value by 1
    ++ is an incremenet operator. So, i++ will make i=7
